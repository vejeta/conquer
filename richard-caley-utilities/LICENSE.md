*                                                                    *
* Written by Richard Caley July 1989 and hacked extensively          *
* thereafter.                                                        *
*                                                                    *
* You may copy, distribute, modify or do what you will with this     *
* code so long as this message remains in it and so long as you do   *
* not charge for it, nor distribute the program without the source.  *
*                                                                    *
* There is a horrid hack for getpass - to make this read the         *
* password from standard in one has to disconnect from the control   *
* terminal. GAG! It should be possible to disconnect just the        *
* conquer from the control terminal . . . someday.                   *
*                                                                    *
