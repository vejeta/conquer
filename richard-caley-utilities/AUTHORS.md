### About Richard Caley

Richard Caley was a researcher at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR). He created this map drawing utility in July 1989 as a visualization tool for the Conquer game world.

His original code comments show attention to technical detail and a sense of humor about the implementation challenges of the era, particularly noting "There is a horrid hack for getpass" - typical of the pragmatic solutions needed in 1989 Unix programming.

### Technical Contributions

- **Map Visualization**: Created bitmap rendering system for Conquer game worlds
- **Game Integration**: Developed data reading mechanisms for Conquer world files
- **Unix Gaming**: Contributed to the early ecosystem of Unix-based multiplayer games
- **Open Sharing**: Released code with permissive license encouraging modification and distribution

## Historical Context

This code represents an important artifact from the early Unix gaming community:

- **Era**: Written during the golden age of USENET source code sharing
- **Community**: Part of the collaborative Unix gaming development community
- **Innovation**: Early example of game world visualization tools
- **Preservation**: Maintained as historical documentation of 1989 programming practices

## Memorial

Richard Caley's contribution to early Unix gaming and his generous sharing of source code represents the collaborative spirit that made the early computing community so innovative. His passing in 2006 was a loss to the academic and technical communities he served.

This code is preserved not just as functional software, but as a memorial to his contribution to the early days of computer gaming and open source development.

## No Modern Contributors

Due to the original author's passing and the specific terms of his license, this code is preserved in its historical form. While the license permits modification, we maintain the original implementation as Richard wrote it.
