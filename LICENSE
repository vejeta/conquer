Greetings Ed,

I'm glad of hearing about you.

Back in 2006 I started a research to look for the history of conquer and
some related games.
I wrote an article back in 2011 here about that process:
http://vejeta.com/historia-del-conquer/

My intention in 2006 was getting a copyleft compatible license to be able
to get the code modified and packaged for a GNU/Linux distribution such as
Debian.

I remember that after consulting with the debian-legal mailing list, I was
advised to get a written email copy from the authors giving such
permissions. (I could dig into such emails). I was surprised when Adam
himself found an article and wrote to me about that.

Also, I remember starting the process of getting the code uploaded to gnu
savannah.

I found two blockers. There was the use of a certain file written by a
third party that needed to be rewritten to avoid legal problems, and also
finding a way to be able to play in a mode that didn't require being a user
in the machine. Making it more like a service that we could telnet to.


It's a cool project  and I'm glad you raise my awarenes about it :)

Greetings Adam,



Sorry for the delay, I haven't seen this email till today,  and your messag=
e comes as a surprise.=20



Yes, I'm Juan, the one who at that time initiated the quest of getting in t=
ouch with Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant, creators of a game that I used to play=
 a lot in Unix as a freshman during 1994 and so on.



During that time I could contact Ed Barlow who told me that you were the ow=
ner of the copyright of conquer v5.=20


It seems it was needed the permission of both you to relicense the code to =
the GPL.=20
I understood that a mail could be sufficient as a way of granting permissio=
n for the relicensing.


I may need to contact you again, if a more verbose statement is needed.=20


Thanks Adam a lot for your interest,


Juan M. M=C3=A9ndez




PS: As I sidenote: I was a great fan of that game and being a merely teenag=
er back then considered you as the famous creators of the game.
So this email was kind of a flashback and a happy surprise, my old college =
partners will be happy with the news.
