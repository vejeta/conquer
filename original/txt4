                    SECTOR DESIGNATIONS

For nations to make use of the sectors that they own, they
must indicate what each sector should be used for. The following
table lists sector designations and the cost for their designation:

  name     symbol      gold cost         iron cost
  ----------------     ---------         ---------
  ZCITY        20 * XDESCOST         5 * XDESCOST
  ZCAPITOL        20 * XDESCOST         5 * XDESCOST
  ZTOWN        10 * XDESCOST         XDESCOST
  ZFORT        10 * XDESCOST         XDESCOST
  ZSTOCKADE        ZSTOCKCOST              ----

All of the following designations only cost XDESCOST gold:
 
  ZMILL      ZUNIVERSITY      ZCHURCH
  ZMINE      ZLUMBERYARD      ZSPECIAL
  ZGOLD      ZBLACKSMITH      ZGRANARY

                      DESIGNATION DESCRIPTIONS              pg.1

ZTOWN  Towns, Cities, & Capitols are your power bases.  You can draft
ZCITY  troops (if population > civilians / 16+(number of sectors)/2)
ZCAPITOL  and can build ships here.  Town tax=rate*XTAXTOWN talons/person and
       City tax=rate*XTAXCITY talons/person.  Both cost a lot to redesignate
       AND take metal to create.  They are captured only if you are the ONLY
       occupant of the sector when the world is updated.  Nations become
       depleted if they lose their capitol.  Cities, Towns, and Capitols
       add to many of a nations characteristics.
ZMINE  Mine:  Produce (tax/100)*XTAXMETAL*Metal*People Talons & Produces
       Metal Ores.  Each mine you own adds to your nations mine_ability.
ZFARM  Produces (tax/100)*XTAXFOOD*Vegetation*People Talons & Produces Food
       Each farm you own adds to your nations farm_ability.
ZGOLD  Produces (tax/100)*XTAXGOLD*Gold*People Talons & Produces Jewels
ZDEVASTATED  Devastated sector.  People dont like to live where devastated.
ZRUIN  Ruins are devastated Cities.  They may be rebuilt to cities at
       half cost or for XREBUILDCOST talons may be redesignated otherwise.

                      DESIGNATION DESCRIPTIONS              pg.2

ZFORT   Expensive fortress. Cost same as town cost. Only for defense.
ZSPECIAL   Produces Exotic Trade Goods - see next page.
ZSTOCKADE   Stockades are minor (+10%) fortresses. They cost ZSTOCKCOST.
ZUNIVERSITY   produce knowledge points (see nation attributes)
ZLUMBERYARD   UNUSED
ZBLACKSMITH   adds to nations mine ability
ZROAD   Roads add 0.1 to communication ability.  1/2 cost to movement,
	but they cost gold to maintain.  You may only build 2 each turn.
        You must have 100 civilians in a sector to build a road.
ZMILL   1.2x food production in one sector range if there are adequate
        people in the sector.  It does not produce food on its own.
ZGRANARY   these "warehouses" serve as a point to store any food for the
        winter.  They decrease national spoilrate.
ZCHURCH   add to your nations popularity and patriotism

sector redesignation requires food ability of XDESFOOD (not forts/stockades).
Stockade, City, Town, & Fort defenses work for defenders with garrison status.

                         MINE ABILITY & WEALTH

Mine ability impacts your nations ability to mine ores (see below), and
wealth impacts your nations ability to use specialty luxury items that
can be produced in your nation.  As such, these are the most important
attributes your nation has.  It is difficult to get these attibutes to
OK levels at the beginning of the game - you must work at it.

mine ability = (people in cities,capitols,&towns)/333 + blacksmiths/167 
             + (number of metal points being mined)/3
add 15 if the nation has MINER power 
add 15 if the nation has STEEL power (in addition to miner bonus)

wealth      = % of worlds gold + % of worlds jewels + % of worlds metal 
                + cityfolk/1000 + townfolk/2000

add 30 to wealth if the nation is either a trader or empire class

The maximum wealth and mine ability is 100.

                                METAL

Many sectors have metal ores.  Nations can use these ores if they have the
appropriate mine ability.  The following table details the metal type, 
required mine ability, metal production value, and percentage of the world
metal sectors containing that type of metal.

                            WEALTH & JEWELS

Jewels is the "generic" name given to any luxury items you can make in
your nation.  Like iron, certain sectors have an inate ability to produce
these luxury goods, which can be used only if the nation has a high enough
wealth.  The following table details the luxury good type, required wealth, 
jewel value, and percentage of the world jewel sectors containing that type 
of good.
