The conqps program translates maps from conquer to postscript suitable for
printing on a postscript printer. Conqps can act as a filter, or you
can give filenames to it. There is a lot of options to customise the output.
But the only option you should remember is the h option, which gives
a brief desription of all the options. If you are anxious to try it out
just type  'conquer -p | conqps >psmap'  which should give you a file called
psmap, which can be sent to a postscript printer. There is a limitation of how
big the maps may be, this lies in the postscript language. But at our
site I have been able to print 256x256 maps (I haven't tried bigger) on
a LaserWriter II.

  Options

 There is a lot of options, but you don't need to know all of them. Some
 options were put in to let advanced users get more control over the output.
 Valid options are 'cfghlLnopstuvWXY'. They do the following:

  c  Turns off printing of coordinates around the edge of the map.

  f fontname  Sets the font to 'fontname', you can use any font that is in your
	      printer. Default is Times-Roman. The program also looks for
	      the environment variable CONQ_PSFONT. The f option overrides
	      both the default and the environment variable.
  
  g  Turns off printing of the grid at the unknown parts of the map.

  h  Shows a brief description of the options and some defaults.

  l  If you print larger maps it's possible to exhaust the memory of your
     printer. This option uses a feature in the Apple LaserWriter which 
     conserves memory, but gives you a smaller map. This option is not
     fully tested, and should probably not be used.

  n  Normally the map is centered around the parts of the world you know.
     This option turns off this feature, and lets the program do as it
     damn well pleases with your map :-)

  o x,y  If you want to print just a small part of a bigger map use this
         option. It makes conqps just to produce one page centered around
	 coordinates x,y.

  p type  Sets the type of paper you have in the printer. Possible values
	  today are: A4 (European standard) LETTER (American standard) or
	  OTHER (should be local standard). You shouldn't have to use this
	  option since the person who maintains conquer at your site should
	  have set the right papersize as default (This is done in the
	  Makefile).

  s size  Sets the size of each square of the map. This is useful to get
	  more map printed on fewer pages, but it will be smaller.
	  Default value is 9.

  t string  Conqps tries to guess a nice title to the map for you. Normally
	    this is something like 'Designation Map for Nation Midkemia on
	    Turn 2' (this title is actually provided from the conquer program).
	    If however you would like to have your own title shown, just use
	    the t option, which replaces the default title with string.

  u  Normally conqps put small pictures in some of your squares instead of
     just letters. This option forces conqps not to do this, but instead
     print the letters.

  v  Puts conqps in verbose mode. For example you will be told how big the map
     is and how big it will be on the printer.

  L,W,X,Y  If none of the paper types fits your needs you can alter the size
	   directly with these options. All these options use one postscript
	   point (1/72 inch) as their unit. L sets the length of the page.
	   W sets the width. X sets the x coordinate for the leftmost viewable
	   pixel on the output, and Y sets the y coordinate. These options
	   are normally never used, instead you should experiment with
	   the p option.

  Bugs

 Hopefully no.
