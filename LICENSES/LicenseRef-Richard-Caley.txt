Richard Caley Map Drawing Utility License

This program draws a map of the conquer world on a bitmap system

Written by Richard Caley July 1989 and hacked extensively thereafter.

You may copy, distribute, modify or do what you will with this code so long as
this message remains in it and so long as you do not charge for it, nor
distribute the program without the source.

There is a horrid hack for getpass - to make this read the password from
standard in one has to disconnect from the control terminal. GAG! It should
be possible to disconnect just the conquer from the control terminal . . .
someday.

See Readme for more details.
