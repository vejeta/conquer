		My home phone is 212-679-1439. Use it sparingly and call
		before 11PM if it is important.  Note that I no longer have
		access to the arpanet and cant really support conquer like
		I used to.  If somebody knows of a cheap (free) way of getting
		a login somewhere where there is network access - HELP ME!!!!
		Since i am "volunteering" my time for this project, I am not
		about to spend millions of dollars to buy network access...
		I can get a modem for my PC if somebody will help me get
		something to call into. -ED-
