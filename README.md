HISTORICAL NOTE:
================
This is based on the original release 4 version of CONQUER. The original
authors made no guarantees to the sanity or style of this code, but believed
that it should work as documented. It included numerous bugfixes from previous
releases and various enhancements.

The original development team included Edward M. Barlow and Adam Bryant, who
set up mailing lists and provided community support in the late 1980s. Their
innovative work created one of the early multi-player strategy games that
influenced many later games in the genre.

CURRENT STATUS:
===============
This version maintains the original gameplay and functionality while being
made available under modern open-source licensing terms. Bug reports, feature
requests, and contributions are welcome through the project's repository.

INCLUDED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION:
===============================
	1) A Brief Description of Conquer
	2) Installation (unpacking) Instructions
	3) Configuration Instructions
	4) Compilation Instructions
	5) Administration instructions
	6) GPL v3 License Information

-----------------------------------------------------------
I   A Brief Description of Conquer
-----------------------------------------------------------
A complete description of Conquer v4 is contained in "man.pag" and can be
generated in "conquer.docs". The game is a multi-player strategy simulation
where players control nations, managing resources, armies, diplomacy, and
territorial expansion.

Key features include:
- Multi-player strategy gameplay
- Resource management (food, gold, metal, jewels)
- Military units and naval fleets
- Magic system and special powers
- Diplomatic relations between nations
- NPC nations with AI behavior
- Random events and world dynamics
- Customizable world generation

The documentation files txt[0-5] contain help information that is customized
from data in the header files and converted to help[0-5] files during
compilation. "make docs" will create documentation from current data.

-----------------------------------------------------------
II  Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD, macOS)
- C compiler (gcc recommended)
- make utility
- curses library (ncurses)
- Standard Unix utilities

COMPILATION:
1. Extract the source code to a directory
2. Review and modify configuration files (see Configuration section)
3. Compile: `make`
4. Install and set up new game: `make new_game`

If curses linking fails, you may need to add "-ltermcap" or "-lncurses"
to the library flags in the Makefile.

-----------------------------------------------------------
III Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------
THE FOLLOWING FILES SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO REFLECT YOUR ENVIRONMENT
AND THE TYPE OF GAME YOU WISH TO PLAY:

REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS:
- header.h: Game configuration constants and settings
- Makefile: Build configuration and paths

OPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
- rules: Grammar rules for NPC message generation
- nations: NPC nation configurations for world creation

The options specified in these files will be reflected in the documentation
and help files when the program is compiled.

IMPORTANT: Edit the following defines in header.h:
- OWNER: Administrator name
- LOGIN: Administrator login ID
- Directory paths for game data and executables
- System-specific settings (BSD vs SYSV)

The "rules" file contains grammar rules for random messages generated by
NPCs. You may customize this with local names or creative content following
the format: %CLASS declares a class, with %MAIN being the top level.

-----------------------------------------------------------
IV  Compilation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------
After configuring header.h and Makefile:

Basic compilation:
	make			# Compile the game
	make clean		# Clean up object files
	make clobber		# Remove all generated files

Game setup:
	make new_game		# Build and install a complete new game
	make install		# Install executables only
	make docs		# Generate documentation

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If linking fails with curses errors, add "-ltermcap" to LIBRARIES in Makefile
- If make gives "command not found" errors, try: setenv SHELL /bin/sh
- Ensure all directory paths in header.h exist and are writable

-----------------------------------------------------------
V   Administration Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE ADMINISTRATION:

conqrun options:
	-m          Create/make a new world
	-a          Add new player to existing world
	-x          Execute update (process turn)
	-d DIR      Use specified game directory
	-r SCENARIO Read map from scenario files during world creation

GAME ADMINISTRATION LEVELS:
1. God: Primary administrator (defined by LOGIN in header.h)
2. Demi-God: World-specific administrator (can be changed during game)

During world creation, you'll be prompted to designate a demi-god for the
world, or you can serve as demi-god yourself.

SETUP PROCEDURE:
1. Create world: `conqrun -m`
   - Sets up the game world and NPC nations per the nations file
   - NPCs use the same password as god initially

2. Add players: `conqrun -a`
   - Interactive player addition
   - Won't work if world is full from scenario loading

3. Alternative - Scenario-based: `conqrun -r SCENARIO`
   - Uses SCENARIO.ele, SCENARIO.veg, and SCENARIO.ntn files
   - Pre-configured world setup

GOD FUNCTIONS:
Access god functions by logging in with: `conquer -n god`
- Modify terrain and sectors
- Manage nations (create/destroy)
- Adjust game balance
- Administrative oversight

GAME BALANCE:
The world generation is not perfectly balanced. Some players may start in
difficult positions. As god, you can:
- Redesignate terrain to improve starting positions
- Destroy and recreate nations in better locations
- Modify surrounding terrain for fairness
- Use the change nation command to adjust player situations

REGULAR OPERATION:
- Players connect: `conquer`
- Process turns: `conqrun -x` (typically automated via cron)
- Monitor via god login for administrative needs

AUTOMATED UPDATES:
Use the included "run" script as a template for automated turn processing.
Modify it for your preferred update schedule and system configuration.

For detailed gameplay help, use the '?' command within the game.
