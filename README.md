# Conquer - Classic Unix Strategy Game

**Conquer** is the classic multi-player strategy game originally created by Edward M. Barlow and Adam Bryant in the late 1980s. This repository preserves both the historical distribution and provides a modern GPL-licensed version for continued development.

## üó∫Ô∏è Special Recognition: Richard Caley's Map Utility

This repository includes a significant historical contribution: **Richard Caley's map drawing utility** from 1989. Richard Caley, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Speech Technology Research and contributor to the Festival Speech Synthesis System, created a bitmap visualization tool for Conquer game worlds.

His work represents an early example of game data visualization, created with the generous spirit typical of the late 1980s Unix computing community. Richard wrote: *"You may copy, distribute, modify or do what you will with this code"* - embodying the collaborative ethos that shaped early computer gaming.

*Richard Caley passed away in 2006. This code is preserved in his memory and as a testament to the early Unix gaming community's collaborative spirit.*

## Relicensing Achievement

This repository represents a successful **15-year relicensing effort** (2006-2025) that transformed Conquer from a restrictively licensed game into a modern GPL v3 project. All original copyright holders provided explicit written permission:
