Description: Classic ncurses multiplayer fantasy war game (1987-1992, recently GPLv3)
 Conquer is a historic multiplayer fantasy war game originally created by
 Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant between 1987-1992. This classic Unix terminal game
 was distributed through comp.sources.games and has been recently relicensed
 under GPLv3 for modern Linux systems.
 .
 Built with ncurses, Conquer runs entirely in your terminal with a character-based
 interface that captures the authentic feel of 1980s Unix gaming. Originally
 described as "not really empire, but close enough to be easily understood by
 those used to empire," it features tactical gameplay, magical powers, and
 multiple fantasy scenarios.
 .
 Terminal-based features:
  * Full ncurses terminal user interface
  * Multiplayer gameplay with multiple administrators
  * Multiple fantasy war scenarios with different maps
  * Magical powers and comprehensive spell system
  * Large variety of unit types and tactical options
  * Originally supporting maps up to 256x256 grid size, now bigger.
  * Screen-based real-time display and interaction
 .
 Perfect for terminal enthusiasts and retro gaming fans, this package brings
 the classic 1980s Unix gaming experience to modern Debian and Ubuntu systems.
 Play locally or set up multiplayer sessions - all you need is a terminal
 and the strategic mind of a fantasy warlord.
 .
 Run 'conquer' to start playing, or 'conqrun -h' for server administration.
